# ConvolutionalCompression
Convolutional Compression works by selecting a pixel, getting the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) values of the surrounding X (your choice) pixels - before averaging them and setting the enw pixel on the compressed image to the average of these 3 colours. It helps to smooth out an image (as colours blend better together) and can also reduce the resolution of the image (shrinking it down) thus compressing it and making the final image smaller
